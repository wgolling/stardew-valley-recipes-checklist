# Stardew Valley Recipes Checklist

v0.4.0

Provides a GUI for keeping track of completed recipes, both cooking and crafting, and calculating remaining ingredient requirements. The user can save and load their progress.

The json files in the `data` folder are procedurally generated from Stardew Valley game files. Future versions of the project might include the script used.

## Getting started

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then download the repo, and in a terminal navigate to the project folder and run

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## TODO

### Before v1.0

- integration testing
- make scroll wheel work in scroll frames

### Future

- make executable file so user doesn't need to use command line
- request rights to use official game assets
